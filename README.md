### What I learned

I learned how to use fetch more concisely and avoid caching


```js
  fetch(url, {cache: 'no-cache'})
```

### Continued development

I need to work some web responsive concepts, because I couldn't be able to create a great experience to mobile users. Plus,
I feel that the variables, classnames and ids are not well named, so, maybe, try to learn how to declare concisely is a task  for the future.
